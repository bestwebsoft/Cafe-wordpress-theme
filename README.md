====================

Cafe is a simple theme with a good-looking design and white background by default. It has fixed width of content section, but it is rather wide for displaying lots of content in posts and pages. The theme has light colored widgets in sidebar and dark footer with extra widget-area. It also has two custom widgets. The first one "Recent comments with excerpt" displays not only the author of the comment or post, but also a short part of it, up to 40 characters. The second one "Recent posts with author and category" displays the name of the author and category info in addition to recent post links.
